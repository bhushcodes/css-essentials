## Introduction to CSS <a name="introduction-to-css"></a>

### What is CSS?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. It defines how HTML elements should be displayed on the screen, in print, or in other media.

[YouTube Tutorial: Introduction to CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfoY53QXEnI)

### CSS Syntax and Structure

CSS consists of selectors and declarations. Selectors target HTML elements, while declarations define the style properties to be applied to those elements.

[YouTube Tutorial: CSS Syntax and Structure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWiT2TWCFjc)

```css
selector {
  property: value;
}
```

### Applying CSS to HTML

CSS can be applied to HTML documents in three ways: inline, internal, and external. Inline styles are applied directly to HTML elements using the `style` attribute. Internal styles are defined within the `<style>` element in the `<head>` section of an HTML document. External styles are defined in separate CSS files and linked to HTML documents using the `<link>` element.

[YouTube Tutorial: Applying CSS to HTML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHUpx90NerM)

### CSS Selectors

CSS selectors are patterns used to select and style elements in an HTML document. They can target elements based on their type, class, ID, attributes, and more.

```css
/* Type selector */
h1 {
  color: red;
}

/* Class selector */
.className {
  font-size: 16px;
}

/* ID selector */
#myElement {
  background-color: blue;
}

/* Universal selector */
* {
  margin: 0;
}
```

[YouTube Tutorial: CSS Selectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rlsX8zg6Zk)

#### Practice Sheet

1. Apply inline styles to change the color and font size of a paragraph element.
2. Create an internal stylesheet to style a list of items with different colors for odd and even items.

Sass is a CSS preprocessor that extends CSS with features like variables, nesting, and mixins.

```scss
$primary-color: #ff0000;

.button {
  background-color: $primary-color;
}
```
